 1. Arthmatic operator:   it is used to perform simple arthmitic operation on primitive data type
       i: addition
     ii: substraction
     iii: multiplication
   iv : division
   v: modulo
2. unary operators: it is used to increment , decrement or negative value
     -,+,++,--, 
3. relation operators: used to check for relations like equality, > , <. they return boolean results after the comparision
logical operators: AND,OR,NOT
Ternary operator: it is the if-else statement. it has three operands 
   condition is if true: if false
shift operators:
 <<, left shift operators
>>, signed right shift operators
>>>, unsigned right shift operator
